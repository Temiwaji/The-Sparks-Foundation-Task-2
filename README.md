# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

Prediction using unsupervised machine learning; The aim of  the task is to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. This is a K-means clustering algorithm task. The dataset used was obtained from https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

For K-means clustering, the elbow method was used. The optimum number of clusters identified was 3. 
Data points points were visualized in different clusters with 3 different colours.
Matplotlib was used to visualize the data.
IDE used; Jupiter Notebook
